1. **Local Data Only**: All financial data, transactions, and profiles are stored entirely on your device's local database. We do not process, collect, or transmit your financial data to any external servers.
2. **Notification Access**: To parse notifications from payment apps (e.g., WeChat, Alipay), the app requires Notification Access permission. This access happens entirely locally on your device for the sole purpose of extracting payment amounts and creating transaction records. We do not access or collect any other notification data.
3. **No Tracking**: We do not include any analytics, tracking, or ad SDKs.
